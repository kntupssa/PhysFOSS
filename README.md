# PhysFOSS - Physics Free and Open Science Society

**Knowledge will accelerate when it is free and accessible!**

This is what we believe in, it says everything we want to express.

In a world where physics research relies on complex tools, data, and code, the freedom of knowledge and software has become a necessity, not a choice!

This is where PhysFOSS comes in, a movement to promote open science, open data, and open-source software within the physics community.

The [KNTUPSSA](https://github.com/kntupssa) has launched PhysFOSS, **but its mission goes beyond a single association**:
> Our goal is to shape a community where knowledge, tools, and experiences are shared freely; a place where researchers, students, and developers learn and create together, not in isolation.

This community follows three key paths, though weâ€™ll explore the details step by step:
- Introducing and promoting open tools and software in physics
- Educating and empowering the scientific community
- Building collaborative projects and fostering collective growth

We are here to experience, learn, and build a community where science is more accessible and scientific collaboration is broader, and this journey is possible only through **collective participation**.
